            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm an experienced researcher with expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data engineering. With a proven track record of developing innovative solutions, 
                I help businesses make data-driven decisions and uncover valuable insights. Expert in synthesizing results in a fast-paced environment, I have a strong conviction about the impact of data and analytics 
                on businesses - this resulted in my career transition from academic research, where I studied physics during my PhD, to the private sector. The academic training instilled perseverance and critical thinking 
                in my problem-solving approach, which helps me tackle hard business problems and present compelling stories to accelerate decision-making. Expert in building quick rapport with stakeholders to understand 
                their needs and prototype solutions or provide data-driven recommendations.
